<h3><a href="#password"></a>How do I change my password?</h3>
<p>To change your password, click on your name located in the top right of the menu bar.
    This will bring up your personal detail page. The area to change your password is just under
    your name, company, and title. There are two password fields labled "NEW PASSWORD" and "REPEAT NEW PASSWORD".
    You'll need to type your new password in both of them. They both start out empty and yellow. If you press the
    Save button at the bottom of the page while both fields are empty, then no change is made to your password.
    When you begin to type, the bottom field will turn
    red and a red "X" will appear. This is telling you both passwords do not yet match. Finish typing your
    password then enter the same password into the other text field. If they match, the bottom text field
    will turn green and a green checkmark will appear.</p>
<p>To the right of the password fields are some good rules of thumb to creating a password.
    While phonebook does not require you to follow these rules, it is a good idea to do so because
    they are simple and they will make your password harder to crack. As you begin to type characters
    in your password, the rules will turn green after you have satisfied their requirement. It should
    be straightforward to make them all green.</p>
<p>Press the Save button at the bottom of the page to put your new password into effect.</p>
